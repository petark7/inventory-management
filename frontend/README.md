# Frontend

## Overview

The frontend of this project is built using modern web technologies such as React.js and Material-UI to provide an intuitive user interface for efficient inventory management. It leverages Redux for robust state management and Redux Saga for handling asynchronous operations. Axios is used for seamless communication with the backend API.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A comprehensive React UI framework offering a wide range of customizable and responsive components for creating sleek designs.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container that simplifies the management of application state, ensuring consistency and scalability.
- **Redux Saga**: A middleware library for managing side effects and asynchronous actions in Redux, facilitating clean and maintainable code.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making asynchronous requests to the backend server.
